# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my page. I’m Idowu
- 👀 Here, you'll find my romance with Python and some stories I'm trying to tell with data. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build reproducible Machine Learning Pipelines. But there's so much more you'll find on this page in the coming months.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that'll use data - large or small quantity - to do amazing things.  

- 📫 You can reach out to me by <a href=idowuodesanmi@gmail.com>mail</a> or send a dm on <a href=https://twitter.com/id_joshua>twitter</a>.
