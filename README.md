# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my page. I’m ID
- 👀 Here, you'll find my romance with Python and some stories I'm trying to tell with data. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build reproducible Machine Learning Pipelines. But there's so much more you'll find on this page in the coming months.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that'll use data - large or small - to do amazing things.  

- 📫 You can reach out to me by [mail](idowuodesanmi@gmail.com) or send a dm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/id_joshua).
