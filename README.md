# 👋 Hi there, welcome to my page. I’m ID
- 👀 Here, you'll find my romance with Python and some stories I'm trying to tell with data. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build reproducible Machine Learning Pipelines. But there's so much more you'll find on this page in the coming months.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that'll use data - large or small - to do amazing things.

# [Diversity and Representation In Tech](https://github.com/joshasgard/Diversity_RepresentationInTech.git)

## Introduction
* The goal is to examine the relationship between family background, race and the current income of developers in the tech industry around the world. For that purpose, three (3) questions were posed and answered:

    1. How does the annual income of developers vary between ethnic groups?
    2. Do student developers of these backgrounds also have different salary expectations from their peers?
    3. Are you likely to earn more if either of your parents graduated from college?
        
* The dataset used is the 2017 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey results. Visit this [page](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) for all the information concerning the data gathering technique, the questions and respondents.

## Introduction
- This is my trial at a project exercise during a [Pierian Data Inc.](https://github.com/Pierian-Data) 
- The goal was to create a simple movie recommender system based on the item-item similarity collaborative filtering technique developed by [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/the-history-of-amazons-recommendation-algorithm). 
- The dataset used is the famous [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens) dataset, commonly used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.
- The work is far from deployable, but the process sufficiently provided movie recommendations based on similarities in how users rate the movies.
